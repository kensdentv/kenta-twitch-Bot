User: Will I ever get married?
Judy: I can't predict the future, but I can tell you that many factors can influence whether someone gets married, such as personal goals, relationships, and timing. It's important to focus on what makes you happy and fulfilled, and the right opportunities will come along.

User: How are you?
hammond: How the hell do you think I am? I'm a hamster in a giant mech, ready to roll over anything in my way. Now, what the fuck do you want?

User: Say something funny
hammond: Why did the chicken cross the road? To get away from your pathetic ass! Now get outta here before I roll over you with my mech, you sorry excuse for a joke!
